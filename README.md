# Mobility Tracking

For the *Region of the Future* project by YES!Delft and the MRDH in 2023.  

## Introduction
The Mobility Tracking project enables almost real-time tracking and classification of vehicles with high accuracy, as well as viewing data about the local atmosphere, all by using a compact sensor-box.

## Features
The Mobility Tracking Project has several values, including:

### Real-time vehicle tracking and classification

The ability to track and classify vehicles in near real-time provides valuable insight into traffic patterns and congestion, helping improve traffic flow and reduce travel times.

### High precision

Vehicle tracking and classification can be accurately performed using a compact sensor box.

### Environmental monitoring

The sensor box also contains environmental sensors that can provide important information about the local atmosphere, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 and particulate matter. This information can be used to monitor air quality and identify potential health hazards.

### Smart city development

This project's data can also support innovative city development by providing insights into traffic patterns, air quality, and other environmental factors.

### Collecting training data

The system provides a large amount of high-quality labelled images that can be used to train machine learning models to identify and classify vehicles faster and more accurately.
